# camel-webcam

This component is a remake of [rhiot webcam component](https://rhiot.gitbooks.io/rhiotdocumentation/content/gateway/camel_components/camel_webcam_component.html) for Apache Camel.

Since the source code of original [rioh webcam](https://github.com/rhiot/rhiot/tree/master/gateway/components/camel-webcam) was not updated for 4 years and does not support new [Apache Camel 3.0](https://camel.apache.org/blog/Camel3-Whatsnew/), I cloned the code and adapted it and modernized it.

I removed code that supported the webcamera on Linux for now. I will try to add it later.
