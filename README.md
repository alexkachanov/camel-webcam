# camel-webcam

This component is a remake of [rhiot webcam component](https://rhiot.gitbooks.io/rhiotdocumentation/content/gateway/camel_components/camel_webcam_component.html) for Apache Camel.

Since the source ode of original rioh webcam was not updated for 4 years and does not supprot new Apache Camel 3.0, I cloned the code and adapted it and modernized it.

I removed code that supported the webcamera on Linux for now. I will try to add it later.
